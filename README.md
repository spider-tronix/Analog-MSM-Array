# Title
## Multi-Stable Analog Memory Array with simultaneous Read & Write functionality.
### Work-in-progress

# Abstract üóí

CMOS-based, multi-bit, analog memory circuit which is used in applications including analog neural networks and fuzzy systems. 
It stores multiple analog values using a newly introduced circuit called Laddered, Inverter Quantizer (LIQAF).
